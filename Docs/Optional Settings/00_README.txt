CPS doesn't support exporting optional settings and APRS data. If you need to map this code plug to a different version than the one it shipped with, you'll need to manually edit or restore the optional settings and APRS configuration. Yes... It's annoying. If AnyTone makes a way to export this data in the future, I will include it.

Depending on your version of software or radio, you may have more or fewer settings than shown here. In that case, you'll have to adapt the code plug using your best judgement. If you get something working please let me know and I'll be glad to include the RDT file in future releases of the code plug.
